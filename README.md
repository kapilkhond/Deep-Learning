##### [Cat Vs Dog classification](https://github.com/kapilkhond/Deep-Learning/blob/master/AS4/src/Q1.ipynb)
-	Performed Cat vs Dog classification (dataset link - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765) using a subset of total 4000 images with an accuracy of 92% on test set.
-	Performed transfer learning using pretrained VGG16, ResNet, AlexNet model.
-	Visualized activations of convolution layers when provided with input image.
-	Visualize class activation using heatmap to understand which portion of the image contribute the most to the classification.

##### [Anomaly Detection in Images](https://github.com/kapilkhond/Deep-Learning/blob/master/anomaly_detection/src/Project_final.py)
-	Performed anomaly detection in images provided by UCSD anomaly detection dataset.
-	Identified anomalies like non-pedestrian entities and anomalous pedestrian patterns in the walkways.
-	Implemented Autoencoder using custom CNN model and achieved MSE of 0.0006.

##### [Deep Neural Network from scratch in Python](https://github.com/kapilkhond/Deep-Learning/blob/master/AS2/src/Part%20-2%20dataset%20-%201.ipynb)
-	Designed a 3 layer (2 hidden layers) deep neural network from scratch in python. 
-	Performed iris dataset classification with an accuracy of 96% on test set.
